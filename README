This application is an example of how backbone.js can be used with Rails to create a simple message board.

How to run this?
	* start with a clean gemset
	* bundle install
	* rails s
	* rake db:migrate (it's setup with sqlite)
	* http://localhost:3000

How to test?
	* This code includes the following tests:
		- rspec for model and controller
		- capybara for requests/integration (NOTE: it's hooked up to run selenium with a real Firefox browser - be sure you have Firefox installed)
		- TODO: jasmine specs. I originally test-drove with capybara, so I did not include jasmine.
		- rake db:test:prepare
		- rake spec
	
	NOTE: Could do more to cover edge-cases, e.g. offline use, concurrency etc. this is pretty simple for now.
	
What it contains:

* Rails Message model
* Rails controller that will respond to the initial HTML index page request and then ajax calls from the index page

* Backbone setup:
	- ensures authentication token is used
	- changes the template syntax to use mustache.js-like brackets (so no conflicts with erb)	
	
* Backbone/underscore-ready templates
	- templates.html.js
	
* Backbone Message and MessageList models
* Backbone Views:
	- MessageListView
	- MessageRowView
	- BaseCreateEditMessageView
	- CreateMessageView
	- Edit Message View
	
	NOTE: The intermediate view is missing from the original flow (the read-only view of the posting). It's functional without it as Edit view can serve the same purpose.
	
NOTE: Pardon my mediocre CSS styling. Did not invest much time there.
